# crossoveros is a platform style menu thats works with windows
with or without explorer.exe
i will add some update soon enough
i think i will use french and english in the making of this program.
you will be able to do most things like windows does actually, but remeber this is a program that works with
windows so dont expect to have a new os but feel like it by closing explorer.exe
i am looking for testers that i will release version and people will comment me the bugs
